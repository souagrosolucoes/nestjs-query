The `@souagrosolucoes/nestjs-query-typeorm` package provides an implementation of `@souagrosolucoes/nestjs-query-core` [QueryService](../../concepts/services.md).

This package is built using [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/#/) and [@nestjs/typeorm](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#typeorm-integration). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.

## Installation
