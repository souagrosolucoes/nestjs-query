The `@souagrosolucoes/nestjs-query-sequelize` package provides an implementation of `@souagrosolucoes/nestjs-query-core` [QueryService](../../concepts/services.md).

This package is built using [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [@nestjs/sequelize](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#sequelize-integration). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.

## Installation

[Installation Docs](../../introduction/install.md#ptc-orgnestjs-query-sequelize)

## Docs

* Read the [QueryService docs](../services.mdx)
* [Custom Service](./custom-service.md)
* [Serialization](./serialization.md) - How to serialize `sequelize` models.
